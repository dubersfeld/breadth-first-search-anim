# breadth-first-search-anim
Java based animated demonstration of Breadth First Search algorithm using HTML5 Canvas, Javascript and AJAX.

I present here a Java based demonstration of the Breadth First Search Algorithm. The algorithm itself is implemented in Java on server side. Javascript is used for display and graph initialization only.

The unoriented graph edges are randomly initialized.

A single search request is sent to the server that responds with a collection of all intermediate search results as a JSON object.

Then the results colection is used in the animation.

When deployed on Tomcat the context root is:

localhost:8080/breadth-first-search
